# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test


docker-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker-compose ps


golden-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 5 seconds."
    - sleep 5
    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"
